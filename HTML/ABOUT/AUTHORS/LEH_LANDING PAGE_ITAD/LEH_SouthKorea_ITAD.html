    <h1>Discussion of the place</h1>
    <p>Yes, everyone visiting Seoul should go up in the city's iconic observation tower. 
	Its position almost on top of a mountain, plus the height of the tower itself, gets 
	you almost 500 meters above sea level and the city below. But leave some time to explore 
	the surrounding mountain area. The tower is near the top of Mount Namsan, and the entire 
	area is Namsan Park, which is run by the city. There are miles of hiking trails to explore, 
	all within a few minutes of downtown Seoul.</p>
	
	<h1>How to get there</h1>
	<p>Take the Subway to Myeongdong Station, Exit 4.
       Walk to FREE slanted elevator (Namsan Oreumi).
       Take the FREE slanted elevator to Namsan Cable Car Station.</p>
	
	<h1>Other places to visit</h1>
	<p>Jeju Island</p>
