    <h1>Discussion of the place</h1>
    <p>Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and literature and is now considered 
	so important an icon that UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013. Part of 
	the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is climbed by more than a million people each 
	summer as an act of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise from its summit.</p>
	
	<h1>How to get there</h1>
	<p>Another easy way to view Mount Fuji is from the train on a trip between Tokyo and Osaka. 
	If you take the shinkansen from Tokyo in direction of Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka, the best view of 
	the mountain can be enjoyed from around Shin-Fuji Station on the right hand side of the train, 
	about 40-45 minutes into the journey.</p>
