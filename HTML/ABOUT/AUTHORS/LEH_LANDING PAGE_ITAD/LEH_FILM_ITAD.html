<p style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">During the 1990s, an immigrant Taiwanese family makes an attempt to adjust to the socio-cultural and 
socio-economic reality of living in the US. I like this tv series because its a really funny series and 
it thought us on how can we adjust from a different culture and just love are real culture.</p>

</video>
<p style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">Young Angus MacMorrow discovers a mysterious egg that grows up to be the Loch Ness monster. As they form a 
strong relationship, the boy's family refuses to believe in the creature's existence. This was my favorite movie when
I'm a little one I used to watch this movie many times because its a great movie which you can learn also a lesson
where you help sea creatures to not be caught by the bad people.</p>
<h2>Fantasy Island</h2>

  <source src="fantasyisland.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">A mysterious man invites a group of lucky guests to his secretive resort to fulfil their darkest fantasies. 
However, when people start arriving, things take an unexpected turn. This movie was just last year and i like this movie
because it thought us about the decisions and regrets in our lives but somtimes those regrets can kill us.</p>
