     <h1>Discussion of the place</h1>
     <p>Feast your eyes on Los Angeles’ urban architectural heritage from up close with a leisurely walking tour. 
	 The Los Angeles Conservancy walking tours take in the city’s top sights and most beautiful buildings, from Downtown’s 
	 historic theaters and Art Deco buildings (on a weekly basis) to the modern skyline tour (bi-monthly). These tours are 
	 extremely popular, so make sure you book a place in advance.</p>
	 
	 <h1>How to get there</h1>
	 <p> Los Angeles is a driving city. There are some trains and buses, but generally people drive everywhere. 
	 We spent at least 20 minutes driving around DTLA trying to find cheap street parking before we gave up and 
	 went into one of the paid car parks. I’m fairly sure we ended up parking in Joe’s Garage on the 
	 corner of 3rd St and Spring St, which cost us about $11 to park there for a few hours.</p>
