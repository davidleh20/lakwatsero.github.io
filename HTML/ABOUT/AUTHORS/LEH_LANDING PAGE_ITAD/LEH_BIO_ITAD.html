	<h2>Childhood Years</h2>
	<div align="justify">
	<blockquote><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my childhoods years, we used to stay in Caloocan most of the times because 
	that is where my mother side is but we sometimes stay here in Manila on in our father’s side because my school 
	was in Manila. <sup>1</sup> Growing up, I had a loving family.<sup>2</sup> I had one sibling.<sup>3</sup> 
	We used to play alot. <sup>4</sup> In Caloocan, with our cousins too, we used to play alot outside because the 
	house is located near the dead end. <sup>5</sup> There are no cars that are passing by in that we can play any games 
	we want. <sup>6</sup> Sometimes we go to computer shop just to play miniclip games. <sup>7</sup> The computer shop 
	was just are neighbors and sometimes we just play there for free. <sup>8</sup> These memories in Caloocan was just 
	very dear to me. <sup>9</sup> When I was a child we went to Laog, Ilocos Norte. <sup>10</sup> This is one of my 
	favorite trips when I was a child. <sup>11</sup> My family and the family of my uncle was there, the uncle was on my 
	mother side. <sup>12</sup> We went there in Laog for many hours because it’s on somehow top. <sup>13</sup> We stayed 
	in the house of our uncle for 2weeks. <sup>14</sup> We have a overnight in one of a hotel and we got the room for a 
	cheap price because my uncle was working in that hotel. <sup>15</sup> One of my favorite experience in Laog, Ilocos Norte 
	was in La paz Sand Dunes. <sup>16</sup> We rent a 4by4 jeep and we also got a cheap price because my uncle was a friend of 
	that person. <sup>17</sup> It was a great experience on riding the 4by4. <sup>18</sup> We also had done a skateboarding in 
	the sand but I got scared because I was only little but my uncle helped me out to do it. <sup>19</sup>It was a really fun 
	childhood that I have. <sup>20</sup> </p></div></blockquote>

	<h2>College Years</h2>
	<div align="justify">
	<blockquote><p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp College life is know as one of the best years. <sup>1</sup> This was so different from highschool. <sup>2</sup> 
	College life helps us experience new things. <sup>3</sup> For some people, college life means enjoying life to the fullest and partying hard. <sup>4</sup> 
	While for others, this time is supposed to be serious on thier career and to study to have a bright future. <sup>5</sup> College life is a big 
	transition from highschool life. <sup>6</sup> I got through a lot of changes. <sup>7</sup> I am already commuting just to go to UE, when I was 
	in highschool my school was just a walking distance. <sup>8</sup> The transition to college is so sudden that we are no longer protected by the 
	surroundings. <sup>9</sup>College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you. <sup>10</sup> I am already in a place full of unfamiliar faces. <sup>11</sup> 
	College life teaches me to socialize and form opinions of my own. <sup>12</sup>In college, I learn to be more confident. <sup>13</sup> 
	I have a good friends that I have part to. <sup>14</sup> At my first expection on college, I thought that we have a free schedule like we will 
	have more breaks but I was wrong we got a full schedule. <sup>15</sup> The first year was so enjoyable at least I’ve got the chance to go to a 
	University. <sup>16</sup> Unlike now we are only having a online classes which is somehow hard to understand the lessons well. <sup>17</sup> 
	Sometimes the internet was too slow so in that I can’t really come to class and can’t hear the lessons well. <sup>18</sup> The times we were on 
	a face to face classes we got to bond with my friends in college. <sup>19</sup> We always eat paotsin and eat it in class. <sup>20</sup> 
	I hope that this pandemic ends in order to have a face to face classes already. <sup>21</sup> In my 2 years in UE I have a good experience and 
	learned new things. <sup>22</sup></p></div></blockquote>
