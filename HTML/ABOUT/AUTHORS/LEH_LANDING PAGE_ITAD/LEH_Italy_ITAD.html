     <h1>Discussion of the place</h1>
     <p>Who could fail to love a city whose streets are made of water, whose buses are boats, 
	 and where the songs of gondoliers linger in the air? It is a magic city, and its major 
	 attraction to tourists is the city itself. The hub of the city is the broad Piazza San Marco, 
	 St. Mark's Square, surrounded by several of its top tourist attractions. The great Basilica of St.
	 Mark stands beside the Doge's Palace, and overlooking both is the tall Campanile.</p>
	 
	 <h1>How to get there</h1>
	 <p> The best way to arrive in Venice is by train, to the Santa Lucia Train Station on the 
	 northwestern edge of the city. There's also a bus terminal and parking garages nearby, at 
	 Piazzale Roma. Venice also has the small Marco Polo Venice Airport, and from there, you can 
	 take a bus or boat into Venice.</p>
	 
	 <h1>Other places to visit</h1>
	 <p>The Cinque Terre</p>
